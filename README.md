House Price Prediction using Random Forest

This project aims to predict house prices using a Random Forest model. 
It involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to generate accurate price predictions based on the provided dataset.

Project Overview: This project utilizes a Random Forest model to predict the SalePrice of houses. 

The process involves:

Data Preprocessing: Removing stop words, tokenizing, and lemmatizing the text data.

Vectorization: Applying TF-IDF vectorization to transform the text into numerical features.

Model Training: Using the vectorized data to train a Random Forest classifier for regression tasks.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using various metrics like RMSE.

Feature Importance Analysis: Analyzing the importance of features in predicting the house prices.

Prediction: Generating price predictions for new data and outputting the results in a CSV file.

Data Preprocessing
The initial steps involve preprocessing the dataset to prepare it for modeling. 
This includes descriptive statistics analysis, visualization of the SalePrice distribution, and histogram plots for numerical features.

Splitting the Dataset
To ensure reliable evaluation, the dataset is split into training and validation sets, with a certain percentage reserved for testing the model's performance.

Model Training
A Random Forest model is employed for training on the preprocessed data. This model, known for its robustness and accuracy, is particularly well-suited for regression tasks in this context.

Model Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which helps quantify the model's predictive accuracy.

Feature Importance
Feature importance analysis is conducted to determine which features have the most significant impact on the prediction of house prices. This insight can be crucial for refining the model and understanding the underlying data patterns.

Prediction
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it is used to predict house prices for a new set of data. The results are compiled and saved in a CSV file, which can be used for further analysis or submission.

Results
The predictions generated by the model are saved for review and can be compared against actual values to measure performance. The output is stored in a CSV format for easy access and interpretation.
